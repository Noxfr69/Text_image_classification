# Text & Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates text and image classification techniques using a variety of algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), transfer learning, and data augmentation strategies. I also wrote a detailed paper on Text Classification with Language Models (LLMs) as a part of this project.
